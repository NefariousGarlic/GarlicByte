🎮 Games to Break
Play anything. Share everything. No stars, no begging.

🔓 No Request Process
We don’t believe in forms or gatekeeping. If you want a game added to Garlicbyte, just fork the repo and throw it in. No waiting. No approvals.

You don’t ask for permission to rebel. You just do it.

🚫 Don’t Bother With This:
❌ No “check the site first” nonsense

❌ No “toadd” folder bureaucracy

❌ No “only use GitHub.io links” restriction

❌ No Google Forms. Ever.

This isn’t a classroom — it’s a digital playground.

🔄 Change Process
There is none. Anyone can move, remove, or revive anything. If a game’s broken, fix it. If it’s lame, replace it. If you’ve got something better, push it.

This is open-source anarchy, not a dictatorship.

🌐 True Decentralization
In Garlicbyte:

Anyone can contribute — no need to “know the admin”

Updates don’t need approval — just merge and go

Trust is built on transparency, not gatekeeping

🛑 Disclaimer? Nah.
We don’t pretend to own what we didn’t make, but we don’t distance ourselves from our community either. If you add it, it’s part of the byte.

No copyright disclaimers. No 5-day delays. Just bytes that bite back.

✊ Garlicbyte > Pickelbyte
Unblock everything. Uncensor everything. Unleash everyone.
Pickelbyte was a wall. Garlicbyte is the hammer.
